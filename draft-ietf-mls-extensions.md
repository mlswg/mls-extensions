# Introduction

This document describes extensions to {{mls-protocol}} that are not part of the
main protocol specification. The protocol specification includes a set of core
extensions that are likely to be useful to many applications. The extensions
described in this document are intended to be used by applications that need to
extend the MLS protocol.

# Safe Extensions

The MLS specification is extensible in a variety of ways (see Section 13 of the
{{!RFC9420}}) and describes the negotiation and other handling of extensions and
their data within the protocol. However, it does not provide guidance on how
extensions can or should safely interact with the base MLS protocol. The goal of
this section is to simplify the task of developing MLS extensions.

More concretely, this section defines the Safe Extension API, a library of
extension components which simplifies development and security analysis of
extensions, provides general guidance on using the built-in functionality of the
base MLS protocol to build extensions, defines specific examples of extensions
built on top of the Safe Extension API alongside the built-in mechanisms of the
base MLS protocol, defines a number of labels registered in IANA which can be
safely used by extensions, so that the only value an extension developer must
add to the IANA registry themselves is a unique ExtensionType.

## Safe Extension API

The Safe Extension API is a library that defines a number of components from
which extensions can be built. In particular, these components provide
extensions the ability to:

- Make use of selected private and public key material from the MLS
  specification, e.g. to encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify and derive fresh key
  material.
- Inject key material via PSKs in a safe way to facilitate state agreement
  without the use of a group context extension.
- Export secrets from MLS in a way that, in contrast to the built-in export
  functionality of MLS, preserves forward secrecy of the exported secrets within
  an epoch.

The Safe Extension API is not an extension itself, it only defines components
from which other extensions can be built. Some of these components modify the
MLS protocol and, therefore, so do the extensions built from them.

Where possible, the API makes use of mechanisms defined in the MLS
specification. For example, part of the safe API is the use of the
`SignWithLabel` function described in Section 5.1.2 of {{!RFC9420}}.

### Security

An extension is called safe if it does not modify the base MLS protocol or other
MLS extensions beyond using components of the Safe Extension API. The Safe
Extension API provides the following security guarantee: If an application uses
MLS and only safe MLS extensions, then the security guarantees of the base MLS
protocol and the security guarantees of safe extensions, each analyzed in
isolation, still hold for the composed extended MLS protocol. In other words,
the Safe Extension API protects applications from careless extension
developers. As long as all used extensions are safe, it is not possible that a
combination of extensions  (the developers of which did not know about each
other) impedes the security of the base MLS protocol or any used extension. No
further analysis of the combination is necessary. This also means that any
security vulnerabilities introduced by one extension do not spread to other
extensions or the base MLS.

### Common Data Structures

Most components of the Safe Extension API use the value ExtensionType which is a
unique uint16 identifier assigned to an extension in the MLS Extension Types
IANA registry (see Section 17.3 of {{!RFC9420}}).

Most Safe Extension API components also use the following data structure, which
provides domain separation by `extension_type` of various `extension_data`.

~~~ tls
struct {
  ExtensionType extension_type;
  opaque extension_data<V>;
} ExtensionContent;
~~~

Where `extension_type` is set to the type of the extension to which the
`extension_data` belongs.

If in addition a label is required, the following data structure is used.

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque label;
  ExtensionContent extension_content;
} LabeledExtensionContent;
~~~

### Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) {#safe-hpke}

This component of the Safe Extension API allows extensions to make use of all
HPKE key pairs generated by MLS. An extension identified by an ExtensionType can
use any HPKE key pair for any operation defined in {{!RFC9180}}, such as
encryption, exporting keys and the PSK mode, as long as the `info` input to
`Setup<MODE>S` and `Setup<MODE>R` is set to LabeledExtensionContent with
`extension_type` set to ExtensionType. The `extension_data` can be set to an
arbitrary Context specified by the extension designer (and can be empty if not
needed). For example, an extension can use a key pair PublicKey, PrivateKey to
encrypt data as follows:

~~~ tls
SafeEncryptWithContext(ExtensionType, PublicKey, Context, Plaintext) =
    SealBase(PublicKey, LabeledExtensionContent, "", Plaintext)

SafeDecryptWithContext(ExtensionType, PrivateKey, Context, KEMOutput, Ciphertext) =
    OpenBase(KEMOutput, PrivateKey, LabeledExtensionContent, "", Ciphertext)
~~~

Where the fields of LabeledExtensionContent are set to

~~~ tls
label = "MLS 1.0 ExtensionData"
extension_type = ExtensionType
extension_data = Context
~~~

For operations involving the secret key, ExtensionType MUST be set to the
ExtensionType of the implemented extension, and not to the type of any other
extension. In particular, this means that an extension cannot decrypt data meant
for another extension, while extensions can encrypt data to other extensions.

In general, a ciphertext encrypted with a PublicKey can be decrypted by any
entity who has the corresponding PrivateKey at a given point in time according
to the MLS protocol (or extension). For convenience, the following list
summarizes lifetimes of MLS key pairs.

- The key pair of a non-blank ratchet tree node. The PrivateKey of such a key pair
  is known to all members in the nodeâ€™s subtree. In particular, a PrivateKey of a
  leaf node is known only to the member in that leaf. A member in the subtree
  stores the PrivateKey for a number of epochs, as long as the PublicKey does not
  change. The key pair of the root node SHOULD NOT be used, since the external key
  pair recalled below gives better security.
- The external_priv, external_pub key pair used for external initialization. The
  external_priv key is known to all group members in the current epoch. A member
  stores external_priv only for the current epoch. Using this key pair gives
  better security guarantees than using the key pair of the root of the ratchet
  tree and should always be preferred.
- The init_key in a KeyPackage and the corresponding secret key. The secret key
  is known only to the owner of the KeyPackage and is deleted immediately after it
  is used to join a group.

### Signature Keys

MLS session states contain a number of signature keys including the ones in the
LeafNode structs. Extensions can safely sign content and verify signatures using
these keys via the SafeSignWithLabel and SafeVerifyWithLabel functions,
respectively, much like how the basic MLS protocol uses SignWithLabel and
VerifyWithLabel.

In more detail, an extension identified by ExtensionType should sign and verify using:

~~~ tls
SafeSignWithLabel(ExtensionType, SignatureKey, Label, Content) =
    SignWithLabel(SignatureKey, "LabeledExtensionContent", LabeledExtensionContent)

SafeVerifyWithLabel(ExtensionType, VerificationKey, Label, Content, SignatureValue) =
    VerifyWithLabel(VerificationKey, "LabeledExtensionContent", LabeledExtensionContent, SignatureValue)
~~~

Where the fields of LabeledExtensionContent are set to

~~~ tls
label = Label
extension_type = ExtensionType
extension_data = Content
~~~

For signing operations, the ExtensionType MUST be set to the ExtensionType of
the implemented extension, and not to the type of any other extension. In
particular, this means that an extension cannot produce signatures in place of
other extensions. However, extensions can verify signatures computed by other
extensions. Note that domain separation is ensured by explicitly including the
ExtensionType with every operation.

### Exporting Secrets

An extension can use MLS as a group key agreement protocol by exporting symmetric keys.
Such keys can be exported (i.e. derived from MLS key material) in two phases per
epoch: Either at the start of the epoch, or during the epoch. Derivation at the
start of the epoch has the added advantage that the source key material is
deleted after use, allowing the derived key material to be deleted later even
during the same MLS epoch to achieve forward secrecy. The following protocol
secrets can be used to derive key from for use by extensions:

- epoch_secret at the beginning of an epoch
- extension_secret during an epoch

The extension_secret is an additional secret derived from the epoch_secret at
the beginning of the epoch in the same way as the other secrets listed in Table
4 of {{!RFC9420}} using the label "extension".

Any derivation performed by an extension either from the epoch_secret or the
extension_secret has to use the following function:

~~~ tls
DeriveExtensionSecret(Secret, Label) =
  ExpandWithLabel(Secret, "ExtensionExport " + ExtensionType + " " + Label)
~~~

Where ExpandWithLabel is defined in Section 8 of {{!RFC9420}} and where ExtensionType
MUST be set to the ExtensionType of the implemented extension.

### Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs)

PSKs represent key material that is injected into the MLS key schedule when
creating or processing a commit as defined in Section 8.4 of {{!RFC9420}}. Its
injection into the key schedule means that all group members have to agree on
the value of the PSK.

While PSKs are typically cryptographic keys which due to their properties add to
the overall security of the group, the PSK mechanism can also be used to ensure
that all members of a group agree on arbitrary pieces of data represented as
octet strings (without the necessity of sending the data itself over the wire).
For example, an extension can use the PSK mechanism to enforce that all group
members have access to and agree on a password or a shared file.

This is achieved by creating a new epoch via a PSK proposal. Transitioning to
the new epoch requires using the information agreed upon.

To facilitate using PSKs in a safe way, this document defines a new PSKType for
extensions. This provides domain separation between pre-shared keys used by the
core MLS protocol and applications, and between those used by different extensions.

~~~tls
enum {
  reserved(0),
  external(1),
  resumption(2),
  extensions(3),
  (255)
} PSKType;

struct {
  PSKType psktype;
  select (PreSharedKeyID.psktype) {
    case external:
      opaque psk_id<V>;

    case resumption:
      ResumptionPSKUsage usage;
      opaque psk_group_id<V>;
      uint64 psk_epoch;

    case extensions:
      ExtensionType extension_type;
      opaque psk_id<V>;
  };
  opaque psk_nonce<V>;
} PreSharedKeyID;
~~~

### Extension Designer Tools

The safe extension API allows extension designers to sign and encrypt payloads
without the need to register their own IANA labels. Following the same pattern,
this document also provides ways for extension designers to define their own
wire formats, proposals and credentials.

#### Wire Formats

Extensions can define their own MLS messages by using the mls_extension_message
MLS Wire Format. The mls_extension_message Wire Format is IANA registered
specifically for this purpose and extends the select statement in the MLSMessage
struct as follows:

~~~tls
case mls_extension_message:
    ExtensionContent extension_content;
~~~

The extension_type in `extension_content` MUST be set to the type of the
extension in question.
Processing of self-defined wire formats has to be defined by the extension.

#### Proposals

Similar to wire formats, extensions can define their own proposals by using one
of three dedicated extension proposal types: extension_proposal,
extension_path_proposal and extension_external_propsal. Each type contains the
same ExtensionContent struct, but is validated differently: extension_proposal
requires no UpdatePath and can not be sent by an external sender
extension_path_proposal requires an UpdatePath and can not be sent by an external
sender extensions_external_proposal requires no UpdatePath and can be sent by an
external sender.

Each of the three proposal types is IANA registered and extends the select
statement in the Proposal struct as follows:

~~~tls
case extension_proposal:
    ExtensionContent extension_content;
case extension_path_proposal:
    ExtensionContent extension_content;
case extension_external_proposal:
    ExtensionContent extension_content;
~~~

The extension_type MUST be set to the type of the extension in question.

Processing and validation of self-defined proposals has to be defined by the
extension. However, validation rules can lead to a previously valid commit to
become invalid, not the other way around. This is with the exception of proposal
validation for external commits, where self-defined proposals can be declared
valid for use in external commits. More concretely, if an external commit is
invalid, only because the self-defined proposal is part of it (the last rule in
external commit proposal validation in Section 12.2 of {{!RFC9420}}), then the
self-defined validation rules may rule that the commit is instead valid.

#### Credentials

Extension designers can also define their own credential types via the IANA
registered extension_credential credential type. The extension_credential
extends the select statement in the Credential struct as follows:

~~~tls
case extension_credential:
    ExtensionContent extension_content;
~~~

The extension_type in the extension_content must be set to that of the extension
in question  with the extension_data containing all other relevant data. Note
that any credential defined in this way has to meet the requirements detailed in
Section 5.3 of the MLS specification.

## Extension Design Guidance

While extensions can modify the protocol flow of MLS and the associated
properties in arbitrary ways, the base MLS protocol already enables a number of
functionalities that extensions can use without modifying MLS itself. Extension
authors should consider using these built-in mechanisms before employing more
intrusive changes to the protocol.

### Storing State in Extensions

Every type of MLS extension can have data associated with it and, depending on
the type of extension (KeyPackage Extension, GroupContext Extension, etc.) that
data is included in the corresponding MLS struct. This allows the authors of an
extension to make use of any authentication or confidentiality properties that
the struct is subject to as part of the protocol flow.

- GroupContext Extensions: Any data in a group context extension is agreed-upon
  by all members of the group in the same way as the rest of the group state. As
  part of the GroupContext, it is also sent encrypted to new joiners via Welcome
  messages and (depending on the architecture of the application) may be
  available to external joiners. Note that in some scenarios, the GroupContext
  may also be visible to components  that implement the delivery service.
- GroupInfo Extensions: GroupInfo extensions are included in the GroupInfo
  struct and thus sent encrypted and authenticated by the signer of the
  GroupInfo to new joiners as part of Welcome messages. It can thus be used as a
  confidential and authenticated channel from the inviting group member to new
  joiners. Just like GroupContext extensions, they may also be visible to
  external joiners or even parts of the delivery service. Unlike GroupContext
  extensions, the GroupInfo struct is not part of the group state that all group
  members agree on.
- KeyPackage Extensions: KeyPackages (and the extensions they include) are
  pre-published by individual clients for asynchronous group joining. They are
  included in Add proposals and become part of the group state once the Add
  proposal is committed. They are, however, removed from the group state when
  the owner of the KeyPackage does the first commit with a path. As such,
  KeyPackage extensions can be used to communicate data to anyone who wants to
  invite the owner to a group, as well as the other members of the group the
  owner is added to. Note that KeyPackage extensions are visible to the server
  that provides the KeyPackages for download, as well as any part of the
  delivery service that can see the public group state.
- LeafNode Extensions: LeafNodes are a part of every KeyPackage and thus follow
  the same lifecycle. However, they are also part of any commit that includes an
  UpdatePath and clients generally have a leaf node in each group they are a member
  of. Leaf node extensions can thus be used to include member-specific data in a
  group state that can be updated by the owner at any time.

# Extensions

## AppAck

Type: Proposal

### Description

An AppAck proposal is used to acknowledge receipt of application messages.
Though this information implies no change to the group, it is structured as a
Proposal message so that it is included in the group's transcript by being
included in Commit messages.

~~~ tls
struct {
    uint32 sender;
    uint32 first_generation;
    uint32 last_generation;
} MessageRange;

struct {
    MessageRange received_ranges<V>;
} AppAck;
~~~

An AppAck proposal represents a set of messages received by the sender in the
current epoch.  Messages are represented by the `sender` and `generation` values
in the MLSCiphertext for the message.  Each MessageRange represents receipt of a
span of messages whose `generation` values form a continuous range from
`first_generation` to `last_generation`, inclusive.

AppAck proposals are sent as a guard against the Delivery Service dropping
application messages.  The sequential nature of the `generation` field provides
a degree of loss detection, since gaps in the `generation` sequence indicate
dropped messages.  AppAck completes this story by addressing the scenario where
the Delivery Service drops all messages after a certain point, so that a later
generation is never observed.  Obviously, there is a risk that AppAck messages
could be suppressed as well, but their inclusion in the transcript means that if
they are suppressed then the group cannot advance at all.

The schedule on which sending AppAck proposals are sent is up to the application,
and determines which cases of loss/suppression are detected.  For example:

- The application might have the committer include an AppAck proposal whenever a
  Commit is sent, so that other members could know when one of their messages
  did not reach the committer.

- The application could have a client send an AppAck whenever an application
  message is sent, covering all messages received since its last AppAck.  This
  would provide a complete view of any losses experienced by active members.

- The application could simply have clients send AppAck proposals on a timer, so
  that all participants' state would be known.

An application using AppAck proposals to guard against loss/suppression of
application messages also needs to ensure that AppAck messages and the Commits
that reference them are not dropped.  One way to do this is to always encrypt
Proposal and Commit messages, to make it more difficult for the Delivery Service
to recognize which messages contain AppAcks.  The application can also have
clients enforce an AppAck schedule, reporting loss if an AppAck is not received
at the expected time.

## Targeted messages

### Description

MLS application messages make sending encrypted messages to all group members
easy and efficient. Sometimes application protocols mandate that messages are
only sent to specific group members, either for privacy or for efficiency
reasons.

Targeted messages are a way to achieve this without having to create a new group
with the sender and the specific recipients â€“ which might not be possible or
desired. Instead, targeted messages define the format and encryption of a
message that is sent from a member of an existing group to another member of
that group.

The goal is to provide a one-shot messaging mechanism that provides
confidentiality and authentication.

Targeted Messages makes use the Safe Extension API as defined in {{safe-extension-api}}.
reuse mechanisms from {{mls-protocol}}, in particular {{hpke}}.

### Format

This extension uses the `mls_extension_message` WireFormat as defined in Section
{{wire-formats}}, where the content is a `TargetedMessage`.

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  opaque encrypted_sender_auth_data<V>;
  opaque hpke_ciphertext<V>;
} TargetedMessage;

enum {
  hpke_auth_psk(0),
  signature_hpke_psk(1),
} TargetedMessageAuthScheme;

struct {
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
  TargetedMessageAuthScheme authentication_scheme;
  select (authentication_scheme) {
    case HPKEAuthPsk:
    case SignatureHPKEPsk:
      opaque signature<V>;
  }
  opaque kem_output<V>;
} TargetedMessageSenderAuthData;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  TargetedMessageSenderAuthData sender_auth_data;
} TargetedMessageTBM;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
  TargetedMessageAuthScheme authentication_scheme;
  opaque kem_output<V>;
  opaque hpke_ciphertext<V>;
} TargetedMessageTBS;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  opaque label<V> = "MLS 1.0 targeted message psk";
} PSKId;
~~~

Note that `TargetedMessageTBS` is only used with the
`TargetedMessageAuthScheme.SignatureHPKEPsk` authentication mode.

### Encryption

Targeted messages uses HPKE to encrypt the message content between two leaves.

#### Sender data encryption

In addition, `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData` is encrypted in a similar way to
`MLSSenderData` as described in section 6.3.2 in {{mls-protocol}}. The
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.sender_leaf_index` field is the leaf index of the
sender. The `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.authentication_scheme` field is the
authentication scheme used to authenticate the sender. The
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.signature` field is the signature of the
`TargetedMessageTBS` structure. The `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.kem_output`
field is the KEM output of the HPKE encryption.

The key and nonce provided to the AEAD are computed as the KDF of the first
KDF.Nh bytes of the `hpke_ciphertext` generated in the following section. If the
length of the hpke_ciphertext is less than KDF.Nh, the whole hpke_ciphertext is
used. In pseudocode, the key and nonce are derived as:

~~~ tls
sender_auth_data_secret
  = DeriveExtensionSecret(extension_secret, "targeted message sender auth data")

ciphertext_sample = hpke_ciphertext[0..KDF.Nh-1]

sender_data_key = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret, "key",
                      ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nk)
sender_data_nonce = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret, "nonce",
                      ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nn)
~~~

The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for the `SenderAuthData` ciphertext is
the first three fields of `TargetedMessage`:

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
} SenderAuthDataAAD;
~~~

#### Padding

The `TargetedMessage` structure does not include a padding field. It is the
responsibility of the sender to add padding to the `message` as used in the next
section.

### Authentication

For ciphersuites that support it, HPKE `mode_auth_psk` is used for
authentication. For other ciphersuites, HPKE `mode_psk` is used along with a
signature. The authentication scheme is indicated by the `authentication_scheme`
field in `TargetedMessageContent`. See {{guidance-on-authentication-schemes}}
for more information.

For the PSK part of the authentication, clients export a dedicated secret:

~~~ tls
targeted_message_psk
  = DeriveExtensionSecret(extension_secret, "targeted message psk")
~~~

The functions `SealAuth` and `OpenAuth` defined in {{hpke}} are used as
described in {{safe-hpke}} with an empty context. Other functions are defined in
{{mls-protocol}}.

#### Authentication with HPKE

The sender MUST set the authentication scheme to
`TargetedMessageAuthScheme.HPKEAuthPsk`.

As described in {{safe-hpke}} the `hpke_context` is a LabeledExtensionContent struct
with the following content, where `group_context` is the serialized context of
the group.

~~~ tls
label = "MLS 1.0 ExtensionData"
extension_type = ExtensionType
extension_data = group_context
~~~


The sender then computes the following:

~~~ tls
(kem_output, hpke_ciphertext) = SealAuthPSK(receiver_node_public_key,
                                            hpke_context,
                                            targeted_message_tbm,
                                            message,
                                            targeted_message_psk,
                                            psk_id,
                                            sender_node_private_key)
~~~

The recipient computes the following:

~~~ tls
message = OpenAuthPSK(kem_output,
                      receiver_node_private_key,
                      hpke_context,
                      targeted_message_tbm,
                      hpke_ciphertext,
                      targeted_message_psk,
                      psk_id,
                      sender_node_public_key)
~~~

#### Authentication with signatures

The sender MUST set the authentication scheme to
`TargetedMessageAuthScheme.SignatureHPKEPsk`. The signature is done using the
`signature_key` of the sender's `LeafNode` and the corresponding signature
scheme used in the group.

The sender then computes the following with `hpke_context` defined as in
{{authentication-with-hpke}}:

~~~ tls
(kem_output, hpke_ciphertext) = SealPSK(receiver_node_public_key,
                                        hpke_context,
                                        targeted_message_tbm,
                                        message,
                                        targeted_message_psk,
                                        epoch)
~~~

The signature is computed as follows, where the `extension_type` is the type of
this extension (see {{iana-considerations}}).

~~~ tls
signature = SafeSignWithLabel(extension_type, ., "TargetedMessageTBS", targeted_message_tbs)
~~~

The recipient computes the following:

~~~ tls
message = OpenPSK(kem_output,
                  receiver_node_private_key,
                  hpke_context,
                  targeted_message_tbm,
                  hpke_ciphertext,
                  targeted_message_psk,
                  epoch)
~~~

The recipient MUST verify the message authentication:

~~~ tls
SafeVerifyWithLabel.verify(extension_type,

### Guidance on authentication schemes

If the groupâ€™s ciphersuite does not support HPKE `mode_auth_psk`,
implementations MUST choose `TargetedMessageAuthScheme.SignatureHPKEPsk`.

If the groupâ€™s ciphersuite does support HPKE `mode_auth_psk`, implementations
CAN choose `TargetedMessageAuthScheme.HPKEAuthPsk` if better efficiency and/or
repudiability is desired. Implementations SHOULD consult
{{hpke-security-considerations}} beforehand.

### Description

This section describes two extensions to MLS. The first allows MLS clients
to advertise their support for specific formats inside MLS `application_data`.
These are expressed using the extensive IANA Media Types registry (formerly
called MIME Types).  The `accepted_media_types` LeafNode extension lists the
formats a client supports inside `application_data`. The second, the
`required_media_types` GroupContext extension specifies which media types
need to be supported by all members of a particular MLS group.
These allow clients to confirm that all members of a group can communicate.
Note that when the membership of a group changes, or when the policy of the
group changes, it is responsibility of the committer to insure that the membership
and policies are compatible.

Finally, this document defines a minimal framing format so MLS clients can signal
which media type is being sent when multiple formats are permitted in the same group.
As clients are upgraded to support new formats they can use these extensions
to detect when all members support a new or more efficient encoding, or select the
relevant format or formats to send.

Note that the usage of IANA media types in general does not imply the usage of MIME
Headers {{?RFC2045}} for framing. Vendor-specific media subtypes starting with
`vnd.` can be registered with IANA without standards action as described in
{{?RFC6838}}.  Implementations which wish to send multiple formats in a single
application message, may be interested in the `multipart/alternative` media type
defined in {{?RFC2046}} or may use or define another type with similar semantics
(for example using TLS Presentation Language syntax {{!RFC8446}}).

### Syntax

MediaType is a TLS encoding of a single IANA media type (including top-level
type and subtype) and any of its parameters. Even if the `parameter_value`
would have required formatting as a `quoted-string` in a text encoding, only
the contents inside the `quoted-string` are included in `parameter_value`.
MediaTypeList is an ordered list of MediaType objects.

~~~ tls
struct {
    opaque parameter_name<V>;
    /* Note: parameter_value never includes the quotation marks of an
     * RFC 2045 quoted-string */
    opaque parameter_value<V>;
} Parameter;

struct {
    /* media_type is an IANA top-level media type, a "/" character,
     * and the IANA media subtype */
    opaque media_type<V>;

    /* a list of zero or more parameters defined for the subtype */
    Parameter parameters<V>;
} MediaType;

struct {
    MediaType media_types<V>;
} MediaTypeList;

MediaTypeList accepted_media_types;
MediaTypeList required_media_types;
~~~

Example IANA media types with optional parameters:

~~~ artwork
  image/png
  text/plain ;charset="UTF-8"
  application/json
  application/vnd.example.msgbus+cbor
~~~

For the example media type for `text/plain`, the `media_type` field
would be `text/plain`, `parameters` would contain a single Parameter
with a `parameter_name` of `charset` and a `parameter_value` of `UTF-8`.

### Expected Behavior

An MLS client which implements this section SHOULD include the
`accepted_media_types` extension in its LeafNodes, listing
all the media types it can receive. As usual, the
client also includes `accepted_media_types` in its `capabilities` field in
its LeafNodes (including LeafNodes inside its KeyPackages).

When creating a new MLS group for an application using this specification,
the group MAY include a `required_media_type` extension in the GroupContext
Extensions. As usual, the client also includes
`required_media_types` in its `capabilities` field in its LeafNodes
(including LeafNodes inside its KeyPackages). When used in a group, the client
MUST include the `required_media_types` and `accepted_media_types` extensions
in the list of extensions in RequiredCapabilities.

MLS clients SHOULD NOT add an MLS client to an MLS group with `required_media_types`
unless the MLS client advertises it can support all of the required MediaTypes.
As an exception, a client could be preconfigured to know that certain clients
support the requried types. Likewise, an MLS client is already forbidden from
issuing or committing a GroupContextExtensions Proposal which introduces required
extensions which are not supported by all members in the resulting epoch.

### Framing of application_data

When an MLS group contains the `required_media_types` GroupContext extension,
the `application_data` sent in that group is interpreted as `ApplicationFraming`
as defined below:

~~~ tls
  struct {
      MediaType media_type;
      opaque<V> application_content;
  } ApplicationFraming;
~~~

The `media_type` MAY be zero length, in which case, the media type of the
`application_content` is interpreted as the first MediaType specified in
`required_media_types`.

## Last resort KeyPackages

Type: KeyPackage extension

### Description

Section 10 of {{!RFC9420}} details that clients are required to pre-publish
KeyPackages s.t. other clients can add them to groups asynchronously. It also
states that they should not be re-used:

> KeyPackages are intended to be used only once and SHOULD NOT be reused except
> in the case of a "last resort" KeyPackage (see Section 16.8). Clients MAY
> generate and publish multiple KeyPackages to support multiple cipher suites.

Section 16.8 of {{!RFC9420}} then introduces the notion of last-resort
KeyPackages as follows:

> An application MAY allow for reuse of a "last resort" KeyPackage in order to
> prevent denial-of-service attacks.

However, {{!RFC9420}} does not specify how to distinguish regular KeyPackages
from last-resort ones. The last_resort_key_package KeyPackage extension defined
in this section fills this gap and allows clients to specifically mark
KeyPackages as KeyPackages of last resort that MAY be used more than once in
scenarios where all other KeyPackages have already been used.

The extension allows clients that pre-publish KeyPackages to signal to the
Delivery Service which KeyPackage(s) are meant to be used as last resort
KeyPackages.

An additional benefit of using an extension rather than communicating the
information out-of-band is that the extension is still present in Add proposals.
Clients processing such Add proposals can authenticate that a KeyPackage is a
last-resort KeyPackage and MAY make policy decisions based on that information.

### Format

The purpose of the extension is simply to mark a given KeyPackage, which means
it carries no additional data.

As a result, a LastResort Extension contains the ExtensionType with an empty
`extension_data` field.

# Security considerations

## AppAck

TBC

## Targeted Messages

In addition to the sender authentication, Targeted Messages are authenticated by
using a preshared key (PSK) between the sender and the recipient. The PSK is
exported from the group key schedule using the label "targeted message psk".
This ensures that the PSK is only valid for a specific group and epoch, and the
Forward Secrecy and Post-Compromise Security guarantees of the group key
schedule apply to the targeted messages as well. The PSK also ensures that an
attacker needs access to the private group state in addition to the
HPKE/signature's private keys. This improves confidentiality guarantees against
passive attackers and authentication guarantees against active attackers.

## Content Advertisement

Use of the `accepted_media_types` and `rejected_media_types` extensions
could leak some private information visible in KeyPackages and inside an MLS group.
They could be used to infer a specific implementation, platform, or even version.
Clients should consider carefully the privacy implications in their environment of
making a list of acceptable media types available.
