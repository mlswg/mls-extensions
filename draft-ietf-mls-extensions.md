# Introduction

This document describes extensions to {{mls-protocol}} that are not part of the
main protocol specification. The protocol specification includes a set of core
extensions that are likely to be useful to many applications. The extensions
described in this document are intended to be used by applications that need to
extend the MLS protocol.

## Change Log

RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS SECTION.

draft-00

- Initial adoption of draft-robert-mls-protocol-00 as a WG item.
- Add Targeted Messages extension (\*)

# Extensions

## AppAck

Type: Proposal

### Description

An AppAck proposal is used to acknowledge receipt of application messages.
Though this information implies no change to the group, it is structured as a
Proposal message so that it is included in the group's transcript by being
included in Commit messages.

~~~ tls
struct {
    uint32 sender;
    uint32 first_generation;
    uint32 last_generation;
} MessageRange;

struct {
    MessageRange received_ranges<V>;
} AppAck;
~~~

An AppAck proposal represents a set of messages received by the sender in the
current epoch.  Messages are represented by the `sender` and `generation` values
in the MLSCiphertext for the message.  Each MessageRange represents receipt of a
span of messages whose `generation` values form a continuous range from
`first_generation` to `last_generation`, inclusive.

AppAck proposals are sent as a guard against the Delivery Service dropping
application messages.  The sequential nature of the `generation` field provides
a degree of loss detection, since gaps in the `generation` sequence indicate
dropped messages.  AppAck completes this story by addressing the scenario where
the Delivery Service drops all messages after a certain point, so that a later
generation is never observed.  Obviously, there is a risk that AppAck messages
could be suppressed as well, but their inclusion in the transcript means that if
they are suppressed then the group cannot advance at all.

The schedule on which sending AppAck proposals are sent is up to the application,
and determines which cases of loss/suppression are detected.  For example:

* The application might have the committer include an AppAck proposal whenever a
  Commit is sent, so that other members could know when one of their messages
  did not reach the committer.

* The application could have a client send an AppAck whenever an application
  message is sent, covering all messages received since its last AppAck.  This
  would provide a complete view of any losses experienced by active members.

* The application could simply have clients send AppAck proposals on a timer, so
  that all participants' state would be known.

An application using AppAck proposals to guard against loss/suppression of
application messages also needs to ensure that AppAck messages and the Commits
that reference them are not dropped.  One way to do this is to always encrypt
Proposal and Commit messages, to make it more difficult for the Delivery Service
to recognize which messages contain AppAcks.  The application can also have
clients enforce an AppAck schedule, reporting loss if an AppAck is not received
at the expected time.

## Targeted messages

### Description

MLS application messages make sending encrypted messages to all group members
easy and efficient. Sometimes application protocols mandate that messages are
only sent to specific group members, either for privacy or for efficiency
reasons.

Targeted messages are a way to achieve this without having to create a new group
with the sender and the specific recipients â€“ which might not be possible or
desired. Instead, targeted messages define the format and encryption of a
message that is sent from a member of an existing group to another member of
that group.

The goal is to provide a one-shot messaging mechanism that provides
confidentiality and authentication.

Targeted Messages reuse mechanisms from {{mls-protocol}}, in particular {{hpke}}.

### Format

This extensions introduces a new message type to the MLS protocol,
`TargetedMessage` in `WireFormat` and `MLSMessage`:

~~~ tls
enum {
  ...
  mls_targeted_message(6),
  ...
  (255)
} WireFormat;

struct {
    ProtocolVersion version = mls10;
    WireFormat wire_format;
    select (MLSMessage.wire_format) {
        ...
        case mls_targeted_message:
            TargetedMessage targeted_message;
    }
} MLSMessage;
~~~

The `TargetedMessage` message type is defined as follows:

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  opaque encrypted_sender_auth_data<V>;
  opaque hpke_ciphertext<V>;
} TargetedMessage;

enum {
  hpke_auth_psk(0),
  signature_hpke_psk(1),
} TargetedMessageAuthScheme;

struct {
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
  TargetedMessageAuthScheme authentication_scheme;
  select (authentication_scheme) {
    case HPKEAuthPsk:
    case SignatureHPKEPsk:
      opaque signature<V>;
  }
  opaque kem_output<V>;
} TargetedMessageSenderAuthData;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  TargetedMessageSenderAuthData sender_auth_data;
} TargetedMessageTBM;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
  opaque authenticated_data<V>;
  uint32 sender_leaf_index;
  TargetedMessageAuthScheme authentication_scheme;
  opaque kem_output<V>;
  opaque hpke_ciphertext<V>;
} TargetedMessageTBS;

struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  opaque label<V> = "MLS 1.0 targeted message psk";
} PSKId;
~~~

Note that `TargetedMessageTBS` is only used with the
`TargetedMessageAuthScheme.SignatureHPKEPsk` authentication mode.

### Encryption

Targeted messages use HPKE to encrypt the message content between two leaves.
The HPKE keys of the `LeafNode` are used to that effect, namely the
`encryption_key` field.

In addition, `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData` is encrypted in a similar way to
`MLSSenderData` as described in section 7.3.2 in {{mls-protocol}}. The
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.sender_leaf_index` field is the leaf index of the
sender. The `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.authentication_scheme` field is the
authentication scheme used to authenticate the sender. The
`TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.signature` field is the signature of the
`TargetedMessageTBS` structure. The `TargetedMessageSenderAuthData.kem_output`
field is the KEM output of the HPKE encryption.

The key and nonce provided to the AEAD are computed as the KDF of the first
KDF.Nh bytes of the `hpke_ciphertext` generated in the following section. If the
length of the hpke_ciphertext is less than KDF.Nh, the whole hpke_ciphertext is
used. In pseudocode, the key and nonce are derived as:

```
sender_auth_data_secret = MLS-Exporter("targeted message sender auth data", "", KDF.Nh)

ciphertext_sample = hpke_ciphertext[0..KDF.Nh-1]

sender_data_key = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret, "key",
                      ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nk)
sender_data_nonce = ExpandWithLabel(sender_auth_data_secret, "nonce",
                      ciphertext_sample, AEAD.Nn)
```

The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for the `SenderAuthData` ciphertext is
the first three fields of `TargetedMessage`:

~~~
struct {
  opaque group_id<V>;
  uint64 epoch;
  uint32 recipient_leaf_index;
} SenderAuthDataAAD;
~~~

#### Padding

The `TargetedMessage` structure does not include a padding field. It is the
responsibility of the sender to add padding to the `message` as used in the next
section.

### Authentication

For ciphersuites that support it, HPKE `mode_auth_psk` is used for
authentication. For other ciphersuites, HPKE `mode_psk` is used along with a
signature. The authentication scheme is indicated by the `authentication_scheme`
field in `TargetedMessageContent`. See {{guidance-on-authentication-schemes}}
for more information.

For the PSK part of the authentication, clients export a dedicated secret:

```
targeted_message_psk = MLS-Exporter("targeted message psk", "", KDF.Nh)
```

Th functions `SealAuth` and `OpenAuth` are defined in {{hpke}}. Other functions
are defined in {{mls-protocol}}.

#### Authentication with HPKE

The sender MUST set the authentication scheme to
`TargetedMessageAuthScheme.HPKEAuthPsk`.

The sender then computes the following:

```
(kem_output, hpke_ciphertext) = SealAuthPSK(receiver_node_public_key, group_context, targeted_message_tbm, message, targeted_message_psk, psk_id, sender_node_private_key)
```

The recipient computes the following:

```
message = OpenAuthPSK(kem_output, receiver_node_private_key, group_context, targeted_message_tbm, hpke_ciphertext, targeted_message_psk, psk_id, sender_node_public_key)
```

#### Authentication with signatures

The sender MUST set the authentication scheme to
`TargetedMessageAuthScheme.SignatureHPKEPsk`. The signature is done using the
`signature_key` of the sender's `LeafNode` and the corresponding signature
scheme used in the group.

The sender then computes the following:

```
(kem_output, hpke_ciphertext) = SealPSK(receiver_node_public_key, group_context, targeted_message_tbm, message, targeted_message_psk, epoch)

signature = SignWithLabel(., "TargetedMessageTBS", targeted_message_tbs)
```

The recipient computes the following:

```
message = OpenPSK(kem_output, receiver_node_private_key, group_context, targeted_message_tbm, hpke_ciphertext, targeted_message_psk, epoch)
```

The recipient MUST verify the message authentication:

```
VerifyWithLabel.verify(sender_leaf_node.signature_key, "TargetedMessageTBS", targeted_message_tbs, signature)
```

### Guidance on authentication schemes

If the groupâ€™s ciphersuite does not support HPKE `mode_auth_psk`,
implementations MUST choose `TargetedMessageAuthScheme.SignatureHPKEPsk`.

If the groupâ€™s ciphersuite does support HPKE `mode_auth_psk`, implementations
CAN choose `TargetedMessageAuthScheme.HPKEAuthPsk` if better efficiency and/or
repudiability is desired. Implementations SHOULD consult
{{hpke-security-considerations}} beforehand.

### Security considerations

In addition to the sender authentication, Targeted Messages are authenticated by
using a preshared key (PSK) between the sender and the recipient. The PSK is
exported from the group key schedule using the label "targeted message psk".
This ensures that the PSK is only valid for a specific group and epoch, and the
Forward Secrecy and Post-Compromise Security guarantees of the group key
schedule apply to the targeted messages as well. The PSK also ensures that an
attacker needs access to the private group state in addition to the
HPKE/signature's private keys. This improves confidentiality guarantees against
passive attackers and authentication guarantees against active attackers.
