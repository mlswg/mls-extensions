I don't think it should be removed, though. The purpose of these additional structs is to allow extensions authors to just request an extension code point, after which they can create any proposal/credential or WireFormat they like without requiring additional code points. It also makes negotiation simpler, as support for an extension always implies support for all proposals, etc. associated by that extension.

There was a part missing, that actually turned out to not be as trivial and I made some more changes. I think that it should be more explicit now. Originally, I thought it could be more similar to `MLSCiphertext`, but it turns out that doesn't work.\r\nI think there's more than one way of doing it, right now I mostly wanted to avoid double encryption.

Hence, the encapsulation is independent of the PSK and only dependent on the long-lived HPKE key.

      "body": "This PR is joint work with @mulmarta, @raphaelrobert and @psyoptix. It includes a brief section on general guidance, as well as the \u201csafe extension API\u201d.\r\n\r\n(The following text was also sent to the MLS WG mailing list.)\r\n\r\nThe extension developer guidance section gives a brief overview over the different places in which MLS is extensible (GroupInfo, GroupContext, etc.) and what properties MLS can provide for extensions in each of those places. There is nothing that can\u2019t be gleaned from the MLS specification or the architecture doc, but it might be a helpful summary for extension designers.\r\n\r\nThe main contribution of the PR is the safe extension API. The MLS specification doesn\u2019t place any restrictions on what extensions can and can\u2019t do, which means that in particular extensions can invalidate any and all of the security guarantees MLS and other extensions provide. While in some cases it makes sense for an extension to interfere with the main protocol mechanics, for the majority of extensions controlled access to a subset of the functionalities provided by MLS should be sufficient. The safe extensions API describes an interface that extensions can use to make use of functionalities like exporters, PSK injection, public key encryption, signatures, etc. without invalidating the privacy, authenticity and agreement properties of MLS. Similarly, extensions that only use this API do not interfere with any other extensions which only use this API. We call extensions that only use this API \u201csafe extensions\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, this is achieved through proper domain separation both between extensions and the MLS protocol, as well as between extensions.\r\n\r\nAs part of the API, the PR defines generic proposals, wire formats and credentials that can be safely used by extension developers. These definitions also mean that an extension developer won\u2019t have to request IANA code points for any additional structs besides the extension itself.\r\n\r\nThe PR also provides two examples of safe extensions: The first example is a simple RBAC extension that keeps state externally. Note that there are many ways to implement RBAC and this is just an example (which will be modified in a later PR, see below). The second example is the already existing Targeted Messages extension, which we have adapted to use the safe extension API.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to note that this PR is only step one. In the next step, we want to provide a safe way of reading and writing to (the state of) GroupContext extensions beyond a group context extension proposal. We felt that the PR had already gotten quite big and we wanted to put it up for discussion in time for a fresh draft of the extension doc before IETF 118.\r\n",

A safe extension must register its own Extension Type unique among all other safe extensions with IANA. That already gives us a unique number we can extend to domain separate all labels.\r\n\r\nFor example, for a safe extension to use HPKE the safe API enforces that the HPKE label is `LabeledExtensionContent` which contains the `ExtensionContent` which in turn has an `ExtensionType` field. As that value is different for each safe extension the full HPKE labels for different extensions is always distinct.\r\n\r\nThe same idea is used for all other extension defined labels in the safe API which means the only value a new extension must register with IANA is its Extension Type.",

This should be encrypted somehow rather than hashed. Hashing just pushes the problem of getting the context somewhere else\r\n- the ability to patch the GroupContext is a problem we are also trying to solve with the (App)Sync proposal. Again, we don't want a hash here.\r\n- incorporating GroupState for which the master copy of this data is elsewhere, but we want to have agreement on it. This is a great use of a hash. ",

As such it's a \"lower-level\" mechanism than AppSync as it's meant to be used by extensions (such as AppSync) rather than an application running on top of MLS. \r\n- ExtensionState doesn't preclude extensions from storing encrypted data. I agree that hashing isn't necessarily the best way to limit visibility, mostly because the hash might leak data to the DS. I'd be okay with removing that sentence. However, as you point out using ExtensionState to anchor data in hash form is still useful.\r\n- ExtensionState doesn't prescribe how individual extensions should patch their data. That's by design, as we assume that the extension will handle that in some other way, for example, via extension-defined proposals. So there's no redundancy with what AppSync is trying to do.",

I have a few questions. \r\n\r\nCurrently [MLS RFC section 12.2-3.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html#section-12.2-3.8) specifies that a proposal list for a commit is invalid if it has more than one Group Context Extension Proposal.\r\n\r\n1. I'm guessing the same reasoning for that rule might mean that a commit can not have more than one \"gce_update\" proposal, is that correct?  \r\n\r\n2. Is it right to assume that a single commit could not contain both a \"gce_update\" proposal and the group context proposal?\r\n\r\n> When the extension exists in the group context, the values are extended with the values from the extension list item.\r\n\r\n3. For the above line, is it correct to say that the values for the extension that exists in group context are \"replaced by\" the values of the extension from the gce_update proposal, or does \"extended with\" mean something slightly different in this context?",

Yes, I'll add validation rules like this here. In particular:\r\nA commit is invalid if it contains more than one `gce_update` proposal, or a `gce_update` and `group_context_extensions`.\r\n\r\n> 3\\.

This should be more specific indeed. But the main point of this proposal is to not replace, but merge the values. What wording would you suggest?",

Safe WireFormats, Safe Proposals, and Safe Credentials share the `mls-extension_message`, `extension*proposal`, and `extension_credential` types respectively;  all of these MUST use the ExtensionContent struct; and all of them use the capabilities negotiation I described. The whole reason I wrote this PR was because it was simply not possible to write rules for safe extension of one these types without stepping into rules that should be defined in the framework.\r\n\r\n>Our thinking was to keep it separate, because *it* [my emphasis] might also be useful for non-safe extensions.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the *it* is. RFC9420 already says what you need to do for non-safe extensions of these types. If the creator of a non-safe extension wants to reuse some structs defined the Safe Extensions framework, I don't see any problem with this, but they absolutely MUST NOT use the IANA registered `mls-extension_message`, `extension*proposal`, and `extension_credential` types.  If you wanted to make it easier to find/reference the `ExtensionState` struct for example, I would suggest we get this PR merged and then we can have a clean PR proposing the move.

The creator of a non-safe extension *could* use the same or similar mechanism, but we can't be prescriptive about what non-safe extension can and can't do. They don't *HAVE TO*. However for safe extensions we can say, they have to do a specific thing. That's why I don't particularly care to spend a lot of energy on considerations for non-safe extensions. It's not that I don't want non-safe extensions to do better, it's that they are free to ignore anything we do say now (the horse is already out of the barn).",

It is appropriate to define an additional LeafNode or GroupContext extension that means support for a specific combination of extensions. In order to determine if a single extension is safe, or if a combination of extensions in a single \"feature\" can safely access the same state, the stack or application need to be configured with that information.
