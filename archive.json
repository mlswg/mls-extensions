The mechanisms here abuse the extension types for labelling things other than extensions, and they don't really provide any value over the base extensibility mechanisms they use.  At best, they provide \"ignorable\" objects of the various types, which is a totally different property than Safe Extensions provides.\r\n* \"Extension Design Guidance\" is not specific to Safe Extensions.

I don't think it should be removed, though. The purpose of these additional structs is to allow extensions authors to just request an extension code point, after which they can create any proposal/credential or WireFormat they like without requiring additional code points. It also makes negotiation simpler, as support for an extension always implies support for all proposals, etc. associated by that extension.

Is there a technical reason for this?\n\nI think it should use `EncryptWithLabel` to ensure proper domain separation with HPKE uses in the MLS RFC. Otherwise, we must ensure that MLS' `EncryptContext` and Safe API's `LabeledExtensionContent` cannot be serialized to the same bytestring (to follow the secure formatting rules of the [Comparse paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1390)). The latter fact seems to hold, under the condition that `LabeledExtensionContent.label` uses a QUIC-style length encoding (which is not clear because it is written as `opaque label` and not `opaque label<V>`). Using `EncryptWithLabel` would make that fact straightforward.",

      "body": "The text describing SelfRemove mentions a SelfRemove extension and a SelfRemove proposal in different places, but while the SelfRemove proposal is defined (as an empty struct) and mentioned in the IANA considerations, the extension is not. The first question is thus: Is there meant to be an extension?\n\nTL;DR: No, I think we should just remove mentions of an extension and stick with the proposal only. (See #68)\n\nThe second question is whether the needs to be an extension. On one hand Section [12.4.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html#section-12.4.3.2) of RFC9420 says that an external commit MUST NOT contain proposals by reference, so the use of SelfRemove proposals effectively needs to change the protocol. On the other hand Section [12.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html#section-12.2) says that new proposals definitions can update the validation logic.\n\nWhile the MUST NOT in Section 12.4.3.2 is technically not covered by the exception made for new proposal definitions in 12.2, I think it's totally fine for new proposals to define whether they're allowed in external commits by reference. Clients need to signal support for the proposal anyway, so there shouldn't be a problem with interop here and groups that don't want to allow SelfRemoves because they can't be validated fully in external commits can just forbid them by policy.\n",

If we go with a u16, the PPRF has 2^16 leaves, which means that after one query, it has a size of ~650kB (16 nodes in a path with 32 bytes plus an index for each node). Following queries add first 15 nodes, then 14, etc, roughly doubling the size each time. If we go with a u32, the size roughly doubles, starting from ~1,3kB after the first query, then again almost doubling with each subsequent one.\n\nI don't have a strong opinion here, just wanted to note that it's a little inconsistent and that the choice comes with a slight trade-off in group state size.",

This would be simpler in that the MLS stack wouldn't have to ask the application for the new state value, and would discourage applications from storing large state in the GroupContext directly...\n\nMy personal take on the issue is that opaque value updates is the only practical technique for the app_data_dictionary GCE in an environment that contains heterogeneous clients.

      "body": "This PR is joint work with @mulmarta, @raphaelrobert and @psyoptix. It includes a brief section on general guidance, as well as the \u201csafe extension API\u201d.\r\n\r\n(The following text was also sent to the MLS WG mailing list.)\r\n\r\nThe extension developer guidance section gives a brief overview over the different places in which MLS is extensible (GroupInfo, GroupContext, etc.) and what properties MLS can provide for extensions in each of those places. There is nothing that can\u2019t be gleaned from the MLS specification or the architecture doc, but it might be a helpful summary for extension designers.\r\n\r\nThe main contribution of the PR is the safe extension API. The MLS specification doesn\u2019t place any restrictions on what extensions can and can\u2019t do, which means that in particular extensions can invalidate any and all of the security guarantees MLS and other extensions provide. While in some cases it makes sense for an extension to interfere with the main protocol mechanics, for the majority of extensions controlled access to a subset of the functionalities provided by MLS should be sufficient. The safe extensions API describes an interface that extensions can use to make use of functionalities like exporters, PSK injection, public key encryption, signatures, etc. without invalidating the privacy, authenticity and agreement properties of MLS. Similarly, extensions that only use this API do not interfere with any other extensions which only use this API. We call extensions that only use this API \u201csafe extensions\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, this is achieved through proper domain separation both between extensions and the MLS protocol, as well as between extensions.\r\n\r\nAs part of the API, the PR defines generic proposals, wire formats and credentials that can be safely used by extension developers. These definitions also mean that an extension developer won\u2019t have to request IANA code points for any additional structs besides the extension itself.\r\n\r\nThe PR also provides two examples of safe extensions: The first example is a simple RBAC extension that keeps state externally. Note that there are many ways to implement RBAC and this is just an example (which will be modified in a later PR, see below). The second example is the already existing Targeted Messages extension, which we have adapted to use the safe extension API.\r\n\r\nFinally, we want to note that this PR is only step one. In the next step, we want to provide a safe way of reading and writing to (the state of) GroupContext extensions beyond a group context extension proposal. We felt that the PR had already gotten quite big and we wanted to put it up for discussion in time for a fresh draft of the extension doc before IETF 118.\r\n",

A safe extension must register its own Extension Type unique among all other safe extensions with IANA. That already gives us a unique number we can extend to domain separate all labels.\r\n\r\nFor example, for a safe extension to use HPKE the safe API enforces that the HPKE label is `LabeledExtensionContent` which contains the `ExtensionContent` which in turn has an `ExtensionType` field. As that value is different for each safe extension the full HPKE labels for different extensions is always distinct.\r\n\r\nThe same idea is used for all other extension defined labels in the safe API which means the only value a new extension must register with IANA is its Extension Type.",

This should be encrypted somehow rather than hashed. Hashing just pushes the problem of getting the context somewhere else\r\n- the ability to patch the GroupContext is a problem we are also trying to solve with the (App)Sync proposal. Again, we don't want a hash here.\r\n- incorporating GroupState for which the master copy of this data is elsewhere, but we want to have agreement on it. This is a great use of a hash. ",

As such it's a \"lower-level\" mechanism than AppSync as it's meant to be used by extensions (such as AppSync) rather than an application running on top of MLS. \r\n- ExtensionState doesn't preclude extensions from storing encrypted data. I agree that hashing isn't necessarily the best way to limit visibility, mostly because the hash might leak data to the DS. I'd be okay with removing that sentence. However, as you point out using ExtensionState to anchor data in hash form is still useful.\r\n- ExtensionState doesn't prescribe how individual extensions should patch their data. That's by design, as we assume that the extension will handle that in some other way, for example, via extension-defined proposals. So there's no redundancy with what AppSync is trying to do.",

I have a few questions. \r\n\r\nCurrently [MLS RFC section 12.2-3.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html#section-12.2-3.8) specifies that a proposal list for a commit is invalid if it has more than one Group Context Extension Proposal.\r\n\r\n1. I'm guessing the same reasoning for that rule might mean that a commit can not have more than one \"gce_update\" proposal, is that correct?  \r\n\r\n2. Is it right to assume that a single commit could not contain both a \"gce_update\" proposal and the group context proposal?\r\n\r\n> When the extension exists in the group context, the values are extended with the values from the extension list item.\r\n\r\n3. For the above line, is it correct to say that the values for the extension that exists in group context are \"replaced by\" the values of the extension from the gce_update proposal, or does \"extended with\" mean something slightly different in this context?",

Safe WireFormats, Safe Proposals, and Safe Credentials share the `mls-extension_message`, `extension*proposal`, and `extension_credential` types respectively;  all of these MUST use the ExtensionContent struct; and all of them use the capabilities negotiation I described. The whole reason I wrote this PR was because it was simply not possible to write rules for safe extension of one these types without stepping into rules that should be defined in the framework.\r\n\r\n>Our thinking was to keep it separate, because *it* [my emphasis] might also be useful for non-safe extensions.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the *it* is. RFC9420 already says what you need to do for non-safe extensions of these types. If the creator of a non-safe extension wants to reuse some structs defined the Safe Extensions framework, I don't see any problem with this, but they absolutely MUST NOT use the IANA registered `mls-extension_message`, `extension*proposal`, and `extension_credential` types.  If you wanted to make it easier to find/reference the `ExtensionState` struct for example, I would suggest we get this PR merged and then we can have a clean PR proposing the move.

If the implementation of the unknown extension can't be delegated to the application, the extension really should have been in the required capabilities.\r\n\r\nLet's take the example of an AssociatedParties \"feature\". It has:\r\n- one GroupContext\r\n- 3 Proposals (adding, removing, and updating this GC)\r\n- A label for a new secret\r\n\r\nThe \"feature\" has a single ExtensionType say it is type 0xBEEF. The proposals are `extension_proposal`, `extension_path_proposal`, and `extension_path_proposal` types respectively. After each of these would be the ExtensionType 0xBEEF and then inside the extension_path_proposal, a selector in the TLS struct to select between the remove and update variants of the struct.",

The creator of a non-safe extension *could* use the same or similar mechanism, but we can't be prescriptive about what non-safe extension can and can't do. They don't *HAVE TO*. However for safe extensions we can say, they have to do a specific thing. That's why I don't particularly care to spend a lot of energy on considerations for non-safe extensions. It's not that I don't want non-safe extensions to do better, it's that they are free to ignore anything we do say now (the horse is already out of the barn).",

For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBEFORE:\r\n              X\r\n              |\r\n        .-----+-----.\r\n       /             \\\r\n      _               _\r\n      |               |\r\n    .-+-.           .-+-.\r\n   /     \\         /     \\\r\n  _       _       _       _\r\n / \\     / \\     / \\     / \\\r\nA   _   _   _   _   _   _   H\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n  X\r\n / \\\r\nA   H\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nBEFORE:\r\n              X\r\n              |\r\n        .-----+-----.\r\n       /             \\\r\n      _               Y\r\n      |               |\r\n    .-+-.           .-+-.\r\n   /     \\         /     \\\r\n  _       _       _       _\r\n / \\     / \\     / \\     / \\\r\nA   _   _   _   E   _   _   H\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n      X\r\n      |\r\n    .-+-.\r\n   /     \\\r\n  _       Y\r\n / \\     / \\\r\nA   _   E   H\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like that algorithm could be entirely deterministic, roughly:\r\n\r\n* Remove the blank nodes from the tree, resulting in an unbalanced binary tree\r\n* The depth of the new tree is the depth of the unbalanced tree\r\n* Place the leaf nodes at the leaves of a tree of that depth\r\n* ... as far left as possible, while still allowing for the intermediate nodes to be placed above them.\r\n\r\nSo you could just have it be done after all other modifications to the tree are done, and all members would do it consistently.\r\n\r\nIn fact, you don't really need a proposal at all -- just an extension that says to always do this at the end of Commit processing, just like you always truncate after a Remove.\r\n\r\nBut it's not clear what resource you're actually saving here.  While this is fun math, blank nodes in the tree do not take up much more space either in memory or on the wire, and they don't cause any additional cryptographic operations to be done.\r\n\r\nAll of which underscores that there's more complexity here than we should be adding at this stage.  Let's make a fresh draft.",

Getting rid of blanks makes shorter paths and fewer ciphertexts, which reduce commit size especially in the PQ setting. I'll try to make that clearer in the intro.~~\r\n\r\nI agree this should probably be an extension, as we want it to happen with every commit. But then the question is whether each commit is trying to optimize for the result of that particular operation, or whether the idea is to converge towards an optimal solution eventually. I'd be in favour of the latter. After all group members should commit regularly to achieve PCS. In the \"scoot over\" case there's not much more to be added in terms of complexity.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It turns out I had misremembered how efficiently blanks are handled in the tree. It turns out that moving members to the left of the tree doesn't make as much of a difference as I thought.",

For that to be acceptable, we need to be sure about the following:\r\n - It solves a real problem (this is being debated)\r\n - It is sound and not terribly complex to implement (that's probably the case)\r\n - There's a good reason not to do it in a new draft (that reason is yet to be clearly stated)\r\n\r\nb) @bifurcation Your proposed solution sounds interesting as well. Given its complexity, it's likely out of scope for mls-extensions. I also think it wouldn't work with the existing tree hash algorithm, thus requiring even more changes.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, we could try to give it another whirl and see if the conditions for relevance can be met. The next step should also be to discuss this on list.\r\n\r\nMy two cents on it is that it's probably good hygiene to move committers to the left. I think it comes at no cost (on average), and \u2013 on the contrary \u2013 will make for tidier trees. Ideally, running some (MC) simulations would show whether we can save on KEM operations.",

Application components can store group configurations within the `ComponentData` struct and use the `SafeAAD` struct to communicate between one another. Furthermore, additional capabilities and attributes outside the group-agreed configuration can also be conveyed through the `app_data_dictionary` extension in the `LeafNode` or `KeyPackage`.
